For the course purposes, we have complete the game. The game has expected
functionalities and we wrap our model with a very pretty UI.

For introduction and more information, please see our webpage for iterat-
ion 6. If you have any questions, please contact us freely.

1) How to compile:

*) We provide a pre-compiled files in our bin folder, namely:
	 ( compiled under java 1.7 )
   We didn't bundle them into a jar file.

*) You can compile the code on your own machine by:
	adding the libraries, kryonet, junit, lwjgl we provided in the lib/
	folder to your classpath. This can be done by -cp or -classpath
	flags
   e.g. java -cp .:./lib/k*.jar.:./lib/junit*.jar.:./lib/lwjgl*.jar \
	`find ./src -type f | grep java` -d <your directory>

*) You can pull our code into eclipse project and edit build path to compile
   as well.

2) How to run the code

* 0) Open ONE terminal for server, open four terminals for exactly four
     clients.

* 1) Please go to the bin folder of this game ../CurseOfMalphamond/bin
* 2) Start the serverside first by this command:

java -cp .:../lib/kryonet-2.21-all.jar \
edu.jhu.cs.pl.group18.CurseOfMalphamondUI.Main.ServerSide

* 3) Start the clientside either in Eclipse (No client terminal needed) or 
     by typing in the client terminal.

java -cp .:../lib/kryonet-2.21-all.jar \
edu.jhu.cs.pl.group18.CurseOfMalphamondUI.Main.CurseOfMalphamondUIMain

in the clients terminal. If you are in Eclipse, 
run the associate java as Java application.

* 4) When you start the client side, the login window will ask for the username
and it will jumps to the second frame to select Character.

* 5) After selecting the character, the game frame will open up and you
need to register all 4 players to automatically start the game. Then enjoy!

3) What we did after final demo
*******************************

* 1) We fix a bug that associates with the healing fountain
* 2) We fix a bug associated with monster revive.
* 3) We fix a bug that soundmanagers can't close correctly.
* 4) We take Zach's advice to move image scaling into our image loader.
     Our UI becomes more smooth.
